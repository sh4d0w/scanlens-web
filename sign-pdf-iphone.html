    <!-- The Problem -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>The End of Print-Sign-Scan</h2>
            <p>You receive a contract via email. The old way: print it, sign it, scan it, email it back. This wastes paper, requires a printer and scanner, and takes far longer than it should. If you're away from your desk? Forget it—you'd need to find a print shop or wait until you're home.</p>
            <p>E-signatures eliminate this friction entirely. Open the PDF on your iPhone, add your signature with your finger or Apple Pencil, and send it back—all in under a minute. No printer. No scanner. No paper. Just tap, sign, send.</p>

    <!-- Legal Validity -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Are E-Signatures Legally Binding?</h2>
            <p>Yes. Electronic signatures carry the same legal weight as handwritten signatures for the vast majority of documents in most jurisdictions worldwide. Key legislation establishing e-signature validity:</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🇺🇸 United States: ESIGN Act</h3>
                <p>The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (2000) gives e-signatures the same legal status as handwritten signatures for interstate and foreign commerce. State-level UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) laws provide additional backing in 47 states.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🇪🇺 European Union: eIDAS Regulation</h3>
                <p>The eIDAS Regulation (2014) establishes a legal framework for electronic signatures across all EU member states. Simple electronic signatures (like those created on iPhone) are legally valid for most transactions, with higher-security "qualified" signatures for sensitive documents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🌏 International Recognition</h3>
                <p>Countries including Canada, Australia, UK, Japan, China, India, and Brazil have enacted e-signature laws. Most follow similar principles: electronic signatures are valid if the signer intended to sign and the signature can be associated with the document.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Exceptions: What Still Needs Ink</h3>
            <p>Some documents still require traditional signatures in many jurisdictions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wills and testamentary trusts</li>
                <li>Certain family law documents (adoption, divorce in some states)</li>
                <li>Court orders and notices</li>
                <li>Utility cancellation notices (varies by state)</li>
                <li>Some real estate documents (varies by state)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For most everyday documents—contracts, agreements, consent forms, authorizations—e-signatures are fully accepted and legally enforceable.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Common E-Signature Use Cases</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>📋 Contracts and Agreements</h3>
                <p>Employment contracts, NDAs, vendor agreements, freelance contracts—sign and return from anywhere. No more waiting to get to a printer. Close deals faster and keep business moving.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🏥 Medical Forms</h3>
                <p>Patient intake forms, consent forms, and insurance authorizations. Complete paperwork before your appointment instead of filling out forms in the waiting room. Healthcare providers can send forms digitally and receive signed versions instantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🏠 Real Estate Documents</h3>
                <p>Rental applications, lease agreements (many states allow e-signatures), and property disclosures. Real estate transactions move faster when signatures don't require in-person meetings or mail delays.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🎓 School and Permission Forms</h3>
                <p>Field trip permissions, enrollment forms, report card acknowledgments. Parents can sign and return forms the same day instead of hoping the paper makes it home and back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>💼 HR and Employment</h3>
                <p>Offer letters, tax forms, policy acknowledgments, expense reports. HR teams can onboard remote employees without shipping documents back and forth.</p>

    <!-- Tips -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Tips for Better E-Signatures</h2>

            <h3>Create a Clean Signature</h3>
            <p>When first drawing your signature, find a clean surface and take your time. Use Apple Pencil if you have one—it captures more natural stroke dynamics. A clean, deliberate signature looks more professional than a hasty scribble.</p>

            <h3>Save for Reuse</h3>
            <p>Create your signature once and save it. This ensures consistency across all your signed documents and saves time. You can create multiple saved signatures—perhaps a formal version and a casual initial.</p>

            <h3>Position Precisely</h3>
            <p>Zoom in on signature lines for precise placement. A signature that's clearly on the intended line looks more professional than one that's oddly positioned or overlapping other text.</p>

            <h3>Review Before Sending</h3>
            <p>Scroll through the entire document after signing. Make sure all required signatures, dates, and initials are in place. Missing a signature on page 5 of 10 means starting the process over.</p>

                    <summary>Is my signature stored securely?</summary>
                    <p>Saved signatures are stored locally on your iPhone using iOS's secure enclave technology. They're encrypted and protected by your device passcode and Face ID/Touch ID. Signatures are never uploaded to external servers without your explicit action to share a signed document.</p>
