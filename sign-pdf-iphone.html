        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Sign PDF on iPhone Instead of Printing</h2>
            <p>You receive a contract via email. The old way: print it, sign it, scan it, email it back. This wastes paper, requires a printer and scanner, and takes far longer than it should. If you're away from your desk? Forget it—you'd need to find a print shop or wait until you're home.</p>
            <p>E-signatures eliminate this friction entirely. Open the PDF on your iPhone, add your signature with your finger or Apple Pencil, and send it back—all in under a minute. No printer. No scanner. No paper. Just tap, sign, send.</p>

            <h2>Are iPhone PDF Signatures Legally Binding?</h2>
            <p>Yes. Electronic signatures carry the same legal weight as handwritten signatures for the vast majority of documents in most jurisdictions worldwide. Key legislation establishing e-signature validity:</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>E-Signature Laws in United States: ESIGN Act</h3>
                <p>The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (2000) gives e-signatures the same legal status as handwritten signatures for interstate and foreign commerce. State-level UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) laws provide additional backing in 47 states.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>E-Signature Laws in European Union: eIDAS</h3>
                <p>The eIDAS Regulation (2014) establishes a legal framework for electronic signatures across all EU member states. Simple electronic signatures (like those created on iPhone) are legally valid for most transactions, with higher-security "qualified" signatures for sensitive documents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>International E-Signature Recognition</h3>
                <p>Countries including Canada, Australia, UK, Japan, China, India, and Brazil have enacted e-signature laws. Most follow similar principles: electronic signatures are valid if the signer intended to sign and the signature can be associated with the document.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Documents That Still Need Ink Signatures</h3>
            <p>Some documents still require traditional signatures in many jurisdictions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wills and testamentary trusts</li>
                <li>Certain family law documents (adoption, divorce in some states)</li>
                <li>Court orders and notices</li>
                <li>Utility cancellation notices (varies by state)</li>
                <li>Some real estate documents (varies by state)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For most everyday documents—contracts, agreements, consent forms, authorizations—e-signatures are fully accepted and legally enforceable.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Better iPhone PDF Signatures</h2>

            <h3>Create a Clean Digital Signature on iPhone</h3>
            <p>When first drawing your signature, find a clean surface and take your time. Use Apple Pencil if you have one—it captures more natural stroke dynamics. A clean, deliberate signature looks more professional than a hasty scribble.</p>

            <h3>Save iPhone Signature for Reuse</h3>
            <p>Create your signature once and save it. This ensures consistency across all your signed documents and saves time. You can create multiple saved signatures—perhaps a formal version and a casual initial.</p>

            <h3>Position Signature Precisely on PDF</h3>
            <p>Zoom in on signature lines for precise placement. A signature that's clearly on the intended line looks more professional than one that's oddly positioned or overlapping other text.</p>

            <h3>Review Signed PDF Before Sending</h3>
            <p>Scroll through the entire document after signing. Make sure all required signatures, dates, and initials are in place. Missing a signature on page 5 of 10 means starting the process over.</p>
