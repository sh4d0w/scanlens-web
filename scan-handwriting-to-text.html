    <!-- The Challenge of Handwriting -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Handwriting Recognition Is Hard</h2>
            <p>Handwriting recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. Unlike printed text, which uses consistent fonts and spacing, handwriting varies dramatically between individuals—and even within the same person's writing. Factors like writing speed, pen pressure, paper quality, and mood all affect letterforms.</p>
            <p>Traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was designed for typed text and struggles with handwriting. Modern AI-powered systems like ScanLens use deep neural networks trained on millions of handwriting samples to recognize patterns that previous technology missed. The result: accurate text extraction from notes, journals, forms, and documents.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Handwriting Recognition Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>1. Image Preprocessing</h3>
                <p>When you scan a handwritten document, ScanLens first enhances the image. This includes adjusting contrast, removing background noise, and correcting for uneven lighting. The goal is to isolate the ink strokes from the paper surface, creating a clean input for the AI model.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>2. Line and Word Segmentation</h3>
                <p>The system identifies individual lines of text, then segments each line into words and characters. This is trickier than it sounds—handwriting often has inconsistent spacing, and letters in cursive writing connect together. Advanced algorithms detect natural breaks while keeping connected letters together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>3. Neural Network Analysis</h3>
                <p>Each word passes through a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on handwriting patterns. The network doesn't just match letters—it understands context. If a letter is ambiguous (is that an "a" or an "o"?), the system considers surrounding letters and common word patterns to make the most likely interpretation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>4. Language Model Refinement</h3>
                <p>A final language model pass corrects errors using vocabulary and grammar knowledge. This step catches mistakes like "thr" becoming "the" or "bc" becoming "be" based on context. It's why handwriting recognition often produces coherent sentences even from messy input.</p>

    <!-- Tips for Better Results -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Tips for Better Handwriting Recognition</h2>

            <h3>Optimize Your Scanning Environment</h3>
            <p>Good lighting is essential. Natural daylight or bright, even artificial light works best. Avoid shadows across the page—position your light source to the side rather than directly above. A clean, contrasting background helps edge detection work properly.</p>

            <h3>Camera Position Matters</h3>
            <p>Hold your iPhone parallel to the paper, not at an angle. Perspective distortion makes letters harder to recognize. Keep the camera steady—blur significantly reduces accuracy. For dense text, consider scanning sections separately rather than trying to capture an entire page.</p>

            <h3>When Handwriting Quality Varies</h3>
            <p>If you're digitizing notes with varying legibility, focus on the clearest sections first. You can always manually correct difficult portions. ScanLens highlights low-confidence words so you know where to double-check the conversion.</p>

            <h3>Language and Script Selection</h3>
            <p>While ScanLens auto-detects language, manually selecting the correct language can improve accuracy—especially for documents mixing languages or using non-Latin scripts. For multilingual documents, scan sections by language for best results.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Common Uses for Handwriting Scanning</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>📓 Meeting Notes and Lectures</h3>
                <p>Convert handwritten meeting notes or lecture notes into searchable, editable text. Find information quickly instead of flipping through notebooks. Share notes with colleagues who weren't present. Create action items and to-do lists from your scribblings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>📝 Forms and Applications</h3>
                <p>Digitize handwritten forms, applications, and surveys. Extract data for spreadsheets or databases. Perfect for healthcare intake forms, customer feedback cards, event registrations, or any paper-based data collection that needs to go digital.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>✉️ Letters and Journals</h3>
                <p>Preserve personal letters and journal entries in digital format. Create searchable archives of family correspondence. Transcribe old documents for genealogy research. Back up irreplaceable handwritten memories to the cloud.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>📋 Field Notes and Research</h3>
                <p>Scientists, researchers, and field workers often capture observations by hand. Convert field notes to structured data. Integrate handwritten observations with digital research workflows. Maintain legible records even from hasty on-site notes.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Accuracy Expectations</h2>
            <p>Handwriting recognition accuracy varies based on several factors. Here's what to expect:</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>

                        <td>Neat print</td>
                        <td>95-99%</td>
                        <td>Best results with clear spacing</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>Connected letters recognized well</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Mixed styles</td>
                        <td>85-92%</td>
                        <td>Context helps disambiguation</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Hasty/rushed</td>
                        <td>70-85%</td>
                        <td>May need manual corrections</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Very messy</td>
                        <td>50-70%</td>
                        <td>Legibility limits all systems</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Remember: even 85% accuracy means only 1-2 errors per typical sentence. Quick proofreading catches most issues, and the time saved compared to manual transcription is substantial.</p>
