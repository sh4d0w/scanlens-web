    <!-- The Challenge of Handwriting -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Scanning Handwriting to Text Is Difficult</h2>
            <p>Handwriting recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. Unlike printed text, which uses consistent fonts and spacing, handwriting varies dramatically between individuals—and even within the same person's writing. Factors like writing speed, pen pressure, paper quality, and mood all affect letterforms.</p>
            <p>Traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was designed for typed text and struggles with handwriting. Modern AI-powered systems like ScanLens use deep neural networks trained on millions of handwriting samples to recognize patterns that previous technology missed. The result: accurate text extraction from notes, journals, forms, and documents.</p>

    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How to Scan Handwriting to Text</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Preparing Handwritten Images for Scanning</h3>
                <p>When you scan a handwritten document, ScanLens first enhances the image. This includes adjusting contrast, removing background noise, and correcting for uneven lighting. The goal is to isolate the ink strokes from the paper surface, creating a clean input for the AI model.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>How Handwriting Scanner Separates Text</h3>
                <p>The system identifies individual lines of text, then segments each line into words and characters. This is trickier than it sounds—handwriting often has inconsistent spacing, and letters in cursive writing connect together. Advanced algorithms detect natural breaks while keeping connected letters together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>AI Recognition of Handwritten Characters</h3>
                <p>Each word passes through a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on handwriting patterns. The network doesn't just match letters—it understands context. If a letter is ambiguous (is that an "a" or an "o"?), the system considers surrounding letters and common word patterns to make the most likely interpretation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Converting Handwriting to Accurate Text</h3>
                <p>A final language model pass corrects errors using vocabulary and grammar knowledge. This step catches mistakes like "thr" becoming "the" or "bc" becoming "be" based on context. It's why handwriting recognition often produces coherent sentences even from messy input.</p>

    <!-- Tips for Better Results -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Tips for Better Handwriting to Text Conversion</h2>

            <h3>Best Lighting for Handwriting Scans</h3>
            <p>Good lighting is essential. Natural daylight or bright, even artificial light works best. Avoid shadows across the page—position your light source to the side rather than directly above. A clean, contrasting background helps edge detection work properly.</p>

            <h3>Best Camera Position for Scanning Handwriting</h3>
            <p>Hold your iPhone parallel to the paper, not at an angle. Perspective distortion makes letters harder to recognize. Keep the camera steady—blur significantly reduces accuracy. For dense text, consider scanning sections separately rather than trying to capture an entire page.</p>

            <h3>How to Scan Messy Handwriting to Text</h3>
            <p>If you're digitizing notes with varying legibility, focus on the clearest sections first. You can always manually correct difficult portions. ScanLens highlights low-confidence words so you know where to double-check the conversion.</p>

            <h3>Multi-Language Handwriting to Text Support</h3>
            <p>While ScanLens auto-detects language, manually selecting the correct language can improve accuracy—especially for documents mixing languages or using non-Latin scripts. For multilingual documents, scan sections by language for best results.</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>

                        <td>Neat print</td>
                        <td>95-99%</td>
                        <td>Best results with clear spacing</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>Connected letters recognized well</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Mixed styles</td>
                        <td>85-92%</td>
                        <td>Context helps disambiguation</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Hasty/rushed</td>
                        <td>70-85%</td>
                        <td>May need manual corrections</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Very messy</td>
                        <td>50-70%</td>
                        <td>Legibility limits all systems</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Remember: even 85% accuracy means only 1-2 errors per typical sentence. Quick proofreading catches most issues, and the time saved compared to manual transcription is substantial.</p>
