    <!-- Why Go Paperless -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Benefits of Going Paperless</h2>
            <p>The average person spends 4.3 hours per week looking for papers—that's 224 hours per year searching through stacks, folders, and filing cabinets. Going paperless eliminates this waste while providing benefits that physical documents simply cannot match.</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🔍 Instant Search</h3>
                <p>Find any document in seconds. OCR makes scanned documents fully searchable—search by keyword, date, or content across thousands of files. No more digging through filing cabinets or remembering which folder you used.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>📱 Access Anywhere</h3>
                <p>Your documents travel with you. Access tax records at your accountant's office, insurance cards during emergencies, or warranties at the store—all from your phone. Cloud sync means the same files on every device.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🔒 Better Security</h3>
                <p>Paper is vulnerable to fire, flood, and theft. Digital documents can be encrypted, backed up to multiple locations, and recovered if something happens. You control who can access what, with password protection for sensitive files.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>🌱 Space and Environment</h3>
                <p>Reclaim physical space from filing cabinets and paper storage. Going paperless reduces paper consumption, helping the environment while simplifying your life. Most households can reduce 90% of paper storage.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- Getting Started -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Getting Started: The Paperless Plan</h2>

            <h3>Phase 1: Set Up Your System</h3>
            <p>Before scanning a single document, establish your digital organization system. Create a folder structure that matches how you think about documents. A simple starting point:</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <pre style="font-family: var(--font-mono); font-size: 0.875rem; line-height: 1.6;">
📁 Documents

└── 📁 Personal
    ├── 📁 Education
    ├── 📁 Employment
    └── 📁 Correspondence</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 2: Prioritize What to Scan</h3>
            <p>Don't try to digitize everything at once. Prioritize by access frequency and importance:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>High priority:</strong> IDs, insurance cards, vehicle documents, emergency contacts</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> Tax documents, medical records, property documents, warranties</li>
                <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Bills, statements, correspondence</li>
                <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Old documents, sentimental items, reference materials</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Phase 3: Establish a Workflow</h3>
            <p>Dedicate time for digitization. A sustainable approach: scan 15-30 minutes per day rather than marathon sessions. Process new incoming mail immediately—scan and shred (or file if original needed). This prevents paper from accumulating again.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Scanning Best Practices -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Scanning Best Practices</h2>

            <h3>Quality Settings</h3>
            <p>For text documents, 200-300 DPI provides good quality with reasonable file sizes. Use 300+ DPI for documents you might need to zoom or print, like certificates and legal documents. Photos and detailed graphics benefit from 400+ DPI.</p>

            <h3>Always Enable OCR</h3>
            <p>Optical Character Recognition converts scanned images into searchable text. This is the difference between a picture of a document and a truly digital document. ScanLens applies OCR automatically, making every scan fully searchable.</p>

            <h3>File Naming Convention</h3>
            <p>Consistent naming makes files findable without search. A proven format:</p>
            <code>YYYY-MM-DD_Category_Description.pdf</code>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2024-03-15_Tax_W2-Acme-Corp.pdf</li>
                <li>2024-02-01_Medical_Lab-Results-Annual.pdf</li>
                <li>2024-01-20_Warranty_Samsung-TV-55.pdf</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Date-first naming automatically sorts files chronologically. Adding category makes browsing easier even without search.</p>

            <h3>Multi-Page Documents</h3>
            <p>Keep related pages together as single PDF files. A 10-page contract should be one document, not 10 separate images. ScanLens' batch scanning mode captures multiple pages into a single, organized PDF.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Which Documents to Keep -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Paper Originals: Keep or Shred?</h2>
            <p>After scanning, you can shred most documents—but not all. Here's a guide:</p>

            <h3>Always Keep Physical Originals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Birth and death certificates</li>
                <li>Social Security cards</li>
                <li>Marriage/divorce certificates</li>
                <li>Property deeds and titles</li>
                <li>Wills and trusts (especially notarized)</li>
                <li>Court orders and legal judgments</li>
                <li>Passports (active and expired)</li>
                <li>Documents with raised seals or notarization</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Safe to Shred After Scanning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Utility bills (keep 1 year for proof of residence)</li>
                <li>Bank and credit card statements</li>
                <li>Pay stubs (after verifying W-2)</li>
                <li>Receipts (except major purchases under warranty)</li>
                <li>Medical bills (after insurance resolution)</li>
                <li>Expired warranties and manuals</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tax Documents: Special Rules</h3>
            <p>The IRS can audit returns up to 6 years back in some cases. Keep tax returns and supporting documents (W-2s, 1099s, receipts for deductions) for 7 years. Digital copies are legally acceptable for most tax purposes, but verify with your tax advisor.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- Backup Strategy -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Backup: The 3-2-1 Rule</h2>
            <p>Digital documents are only as safe as your backup strategy. Follow the 3-2-1 rule:</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>3 Copies of Your Data</h3>
                <p>The original plus two backups. If one fails, you still have redundancy. For critical documents, consider even more copies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>2 Different Storage Types</h3>
                <p>Don't put all eggs in one basket. Combine cloud storage with local storage. If a cloud service has issues, you have local access. If your device is lost, cloud has your files.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>1 Off-Site Backup</h3>
                <p>At least one backup should be physically separate. Cloud storage counts as off-site. Alternatively, keep an encrypted drive at a family member's home or safe deposit box.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Practical Implementation</h3>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What documents should I digitize first?</summary>
                    <p>Start with frequently accessed documents like IDs, insurance cards, and vehicle registrations. Then move to important records: tax documents (last 7 years), medical records, warranties, and financial statements. Save sentimental items like letters and photos for last—they take longer to process properly.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Should I keep paper originals after scanning?</summary>
                    <p>Keep originals for: legal documents requiring signatures, property deeds, birth/death certificates, wills, and anything with notarized seals. Most other documents can be shredded after verified digital backup. Check specific requirements for tax documents in your jurisdiction—most accept digital copies, but some require originals for audits.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What file format should I use for scanned documents?</summary>
                    <p>PDF is the standard for documents—it's universally readable and supports multi-page files. Use PDF/A format for long-term archival of critical documents. JPEG works for photos or quick sharing. PNG is best for documents with graphics that need lossless quality. Always enable OCR for searchable text within PDFs.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How should I organize scanned files?</summary>
                    <p>Create main categories (Financial, Medical, Legal, Personal, Home) with subcategories as needed. Use consistent naming: YYYY-MM-DD_DocumentType_Description. Example: 2024-01-15_Tax_W2-Employer-Name.pdf. This makes files both browsable in folders and searchable by content or filename.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's the best backup strategy for digital documents?</summary>
                    <p>Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of data, on 2 different types of media, with 1 copy off-site. A practical setup: iCloud or Google Drive for daily access, Time Machine backup on a local drive, and an encrypted external drive stored at a family member's home or safe deposit box for disaster recovery.</p>
