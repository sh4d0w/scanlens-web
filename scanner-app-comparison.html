            <h2>Best Scanner App Recommendations by Use Case</h2>

            <h3>Best Scanner App for Privacy-Sensitive Documents</h3>
            <p><strong>Choose: ScanLens or Apple Notes</strong><br>
            Both process documents entirely on-device. Your tax returns, medical records, and legal documents never touch external servers. ScanLens offers more features; Notes is simpler.</p>

            <h3>Best Scanner App for Adobe Users</h3>
            <p><strong>Choose: Adobe Scan</strong><br>
            If you're already in the Adobe ecosystem with Acrobat and Document Cloud, Adobe Scan integrates seamlessly. The subscription is expensive, but it may be included in existing Adobe plans.</p>

            <h3>Best Scanner App for Microsoft 365 Users</h3>
            <p><strong>Choose: Microsoft Lens</strong><br>
            Direct integration with OneDrive, Word, and PowerPoint makes it natural for Microsoft-centric workflows. Export to editable Word documents is particularly useful.</p>

            <h3>Best Free Scanner App for Students</h3>
            <p><strong>Choose: ScanLens</strong><br>
            Full features including handwriting OCR are free—no premium tier to unlock. Students scanning lecture notes and textbook pages get everything without payment.</p>

            <h3>Best Scanner App for Cross-Platform Teams</h3>
            <p><strong>Choose: CamScanner or ScanLens</strong><br>
            CamScanner works on Android, iOS, and web. ScanLens exports to any cloud service, making it compatible with cross-platform teams even though the app itself is iOS-only.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's the best free scanner app for iPhone?</summary>
                    <p>ScanLens offers the most features for free, including OCR, PDF creation, and cloud sync without subscriptions or ads. Apple Notes scanner is completely free but limited in features. Adobe Scan is free for basic use but requires a $9.99/month subscription for advanced features like PDF editing and unlimited OCR exports.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is CamScanner safe to use in 2025?</summary>
                    <p>CamScanner is generally safe for personal use. Past security concerns (a 2019 malware incident affecting the free version on Google Play) have been addressed. However, documents are processed on their servers, which may not be suitable for sensitive business or legal documents. Consider on-device alternatives like ScanLens for privacy-sensitive scanning.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Which scanner app has the best OCR?</summary>
                    <p>For printed text, Adobe Scan and ScanLens lead in accuracy. For handwriting recognition, ScanLens's on-device AI processing typically provides better accuracy because it's trained specifically for handwriting patterns. Microsoft Lens and Google Drive also offer solid OCR for printed documents.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I use Apple Notes instead of a scanner app?</summary>
                    <p>Apple Notes has basic scanning built-in and is completely free with on-device processing. However, it lacks advanced features like batch scanning optimization, handwriting OCR, granular PDF export controls, and sophisticated document organization. For occasional scanning, Notes works well; for regular use, dedicated apps offer better efficiency.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Which scanner app works best offline?</summary>
                    <p>ScanLens performs all processing on-device, working fully offline without any feature limitations. Apple Notes also works offline. CamScanner and some Adobe Scan features require internet connection for cloud-based processing. Microsoft Lens works offline for basic capture but needs connection for OCR.</p>
