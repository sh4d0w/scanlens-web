    <!-- Why Cloud Backup -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Backup Scans to Cloud Storage</h2>
            <p>Documents stored only on your phone are vulnerable. Lost phone, stolen device, accidental deletion, software corruption—any of these can wipe out years of important records instantly.</p>
            <p>Cloud backup creates an automatic safety net. Every scan uploads to secure servers moments after capture. If something happens to your phone, your documents remain safe and accessible from any device.</p>
            <p>Beyond protection, cloud storage enables access from anywhere. Pull up a contract on your laptop, check a receipt from your tablet, share a scan with colleagues—all without touching your phone.</p>

    <!-- Auto-Upload Feature -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Auto-Upload: Set It and Forget It</h2>
            <p>Manual uploads are tedious and easy to forget. ScanLens Auto-Upload eliminates the hassle—connect your cloud service once, then every scan automatically uploads in the background.</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Background Sync</h3>
                <p>Uploads happen silently while you continue scanning. No waiting, no progress bars blocking your workflow. Documents reach the cloud within moments of capture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Offline Queue</h3>
                <p>No internet? No problem. Scans queue locally and upload automatically when connectivity returns. Scan on a plane, documents upload when you land.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Multi-Destination Upload</h3>
                <p>Upload to multiple cloud services simultaneously. Keep copies in both Google Drive and Dropbox for redundant backup. Different clouds for different purposes—personal and work separation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Organized Folder Structure</h3>
                <p>Documents upload to a dedicated ScanLens folder in your cloud storage. Maintains the same folder organization you create in the app. Everything stays structured and findable.</p>

                    <summary>Can I upload to multiple cloud services simultaneously?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, you can connect multiple cloud services and configure auto-upload to send documents to several destinations at once. This is useful for redundant backups or keeping separate personal and work archives.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Are my documents secure during cloud upload?</summary>
                    <p>All uploads use encrypted HTTPS connections. Your cloud provider (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Dropbox) provides additional encryption for stored files. For extra security, password-protect sensitive PDFs before uploading.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does cloud upload use cellular data?</summary>
                    <p>You can configure upload behavior in settings. Options include Wi-Fi only (saves cellular data) or Wi-Fi and cellular (uploads immediately anywhere). The choice is yours based on your data plan.</p>
