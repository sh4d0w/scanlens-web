    <!-- Why Scan Passports -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Scan Your Passport</h2>
            <p>Your passport is your most important travel document. Losing it abroad means embassy visits, temporary travel documents, and potentially canceled plans. A digital copy doesn't replace your physical passport, but it significantly simplifies emergency procedures.</p>
            <p>Beyond emergencies, passport scans are required for visa applications, hotel check-ins, rental car reservations, and various travel services. Having a high-quality scan ready saves time at every step of travel planning.</p>
            <p>Passport scanner mode is optimized specifically for passport dimensions and features—the data page with your photo, the machine-readable zone (MRZ), and any visa stamps you need to document.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Passport Scanner Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Passport-Optimized Frame Guide</h3>
                <p>Passport mode displays a guide frame matching ISO/IEC 7810 ID-3 dimensions (125 × 88 mm)—the international standard for passport booklets. This ensures the entire data page is captured without cropping critical information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Fold Line Indicator</h3>
                <p>An orange line indicates where the passport spine should align. This helps you position an open passport correctly, ensuring both the data page and facing page (if needed) are captured properly without the binding obscuring text.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Machine-Readable Zone Capture</h3>
                <p>The MRZ at the bottom of your passport data page contains encoded information used by immigration systems. ScanLens captures this zone at sufficient resolution for the text to remain machine-readable in the scan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Multi-Page Passport Scanning</h3>
                <p>Visa applications often require scans of multiple passport pages—data page, visa stamps, entry/exit stamps. Scan as many pages as needed into a single document. Pages are numbered and organized automatically.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <h2>Passport Scans for Visa Applications</h2>

                <p>If your passport is lost or stolen abroad, having a scanned copy speeds up the replacement process at embassies and consulates. Officials can verify your identity and citizenship more quickly with documentation.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Hotel and Car Rental Check-In</h3>

                <h3>Immigration Pre-Screening</h3>
                <p>Some countries allow pre-registration using passport scans. Programs like ESTA, eTA, and various e-visa systems accept uploaded passport scans. High-quality scans pass automated document checks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Offline Access to Passport Copy</h3>

            <h2>Privacy Protection for Passport Scans</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Complete On-Device Processing</h3>
                <p>All passport scanning, image processing, and OCR happens locally on your iPhone. Your passport data never touches external servers. The app functions entirely offline for passport scanning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Privacy Notice Confirmation</h3>
                <p>When entering Passport mode, a clear notice confirms that all data stays on your device. This transparency ensures you understand exactly how your sensitive travel documents are handled.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Secure Local Storage</h3>
                <p>Scanned passports are stored in your local document library. Enable app lock with Face ID or Touch ID to add biometric protection. Only you can access your scanned passport documents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Controlled Sharing</h3>
                <p>You decide when and how to share passport scans. Share directly via email for visa applications, or export to secure cloud storage. The app never automatically uploads or shares your documents.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Quality Passport Scans</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Flatten the Passport</h3>
                <p>Passports don't lie perfectly flat when open. Gently press on the pages or use a book to hold them down. Curved pages create shadows and distortion near the spine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Use Even Lighting</h3>
                <p>Passport data pages often have holographic security features that reflect light. Scan in diffused natural light or with multiple light sources. Avoid direct overhead lighting that creates glare on laminated surfaces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Capture the Full MRZ</h3>
                <p>The machine-readable zone (two lines of text at the bottom) must be complete and legible. Ensure this area is fully within the frame and sharply focused. Some visa systems read the MRZ automatically from your scan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Check Photo Clarity</h3>
                <p>Your passport photo should be clearly visible in the scan. Officials compare the scan photo to your face for verification. Ensure the photo area has no glare, shadows, or blur.</p>

                    <p>Open ScanLens and select Passport mode from the scanning options. Open your passport to the data page (the page with your photo). Position the passport within the guide frame, aligning the spine with the fold indicator. Capture when properly aligned—the app automatically corrects perspective and enhances the image.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is passport scanning secure?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, all passport scanning in ScanLens happens entirely on your iPhone. Your passport data—photo, personal information, passport number—is never uploaded to external servers. The app displays a privacy notice confirming on-device processing when you enter Passport scanning mode.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What passport pages should I scan?</summary>
                    <p>For most purposes, scan the data page containing your photo, personal information, and machine-readable zone (MRZ). For visa applications, also scan any existing visa pages, entry/exit stamps, or amendment pages as specifically required by the embassy or consulate.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I use scanned passports for visa applications?</summary>
                    <p>Many visa applications accept scanned passport copies for initial submission or e-visa applications. Check specific embassy requirements—some require color scans at particular resolutions (often 300 DPI). ScanLens captures high-resolution color images suitable for most visa application systems.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does a scan replace my physical passport?</summary>
                    <p>No, a scanned copy does not replace your physical passport for border crossings or official identification. However, scans are valuable for visa applications, emergency documentation, hotel check-ins, and as a backup reference if your physical passport is lost or stolen.</p>
