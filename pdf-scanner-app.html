    <!-- Content Section 1: How PDF Scanning Works -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>How PDF Scanning Works in ScanLens</h2>
            <p>When you scan a document with ScanLens, your iPhone camera captures a high-resolution image that goes through our advanced processing pipeline. The app automatically detects document edges using computer vision algorithms, corrects perspective distortion, and enhances the image for optimal readability.</p>
            <p>Our AI-powered image processing removes shadows, adjusts contrast, and sharpens text to produce crisp, professional-looking scans. The processed image is then converted into a PDF document that maintains the highest possible quality while keeping file sizes manageable.</p>
            <p>Unlike simple photo-to-PDF converters, ScanLens understands document structure. It recognizes headers, paragraphs, and tables, preserving the logical flow of your documents. This intelligent processing ensures your scanned PDFs look as good as—or better than—the original paper documents.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 2: PDF Quality & Compression -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>PDF Quality and Compression Options</h2>
            <p>Every scanning situation is different. Sometimes you need pixel-perfect archival quality; other times, you need a small file for quick email sharing. ScanLens gives you complete control over the quality-size tradeoff with three compression presets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Quality:</strong> Minimal compression preserving every detail. Ideal for legal documents, contracts, and archival purposes where quality cannot be compromised.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Smart compression that maintains excellent readability while reducing file size by up to 60%. Perfect for most everyday scanning needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Compression:</strong> Aggressive optimization for the smallest possible file size. Great for sharing via messaging apps or when storage space is limited.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h4>Smart Compression Technology</h4>
                <p>ScanLens analyzes each page to determine the optimal compression settings. Text-heavy documents use different algorithms than image-rich pages, ensuring you always get the best results.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 3: Searchable PDFs with OCR -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Create Searchable PDFs with AI-Powered OCR</h2>
            <p>One of the most powerful features of ScanLens is its ability to create fully searchable PDFs. Our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology extracts text from your scanned images, embedding it invisibly within the PDF file.</p>
            <p>This means you can search for any word or phrase within your scanned documents using any PDF reader. Looking for that specific clause in a 50-page contract? Just use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) and find it instantly. No more scrolling through pages manually.</p>
            <h3>OCR Language Support</h3>
            <p>ScanLens OCR supports over 50 languages, including complex scripts like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Hebrew. The recognition engine is trained on millions of documents, achieving 99.5% accuracy on printed text and impressive results even with handwritten notes.</p>
            <p>For documents containing multiple languages, ScanLens automatically detects and processes each language appropriately, ensuring accurate text extraction regardless of the content mix.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Section 4: PDF/A Archival Format -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>PDF/A: Long-Term Document Archival</h2>
            <p>For documents that need to remain accessible for years or decades, ScanLens supports the PDF/A archival format. PDF/A is an ISO-standardized version of PDF designed specifically for long-term digital preservation.</p>
            <p>Unlike regular PDFs, PDF/A documents are self-contained. All fonts, color profiles, and metadata are embedded within the file, ensuring the document will display identically on any system, now or in the future. This makes PDF/A the preferred format for legal archives, medical records, and government documents.</p>
            <h3>When to Use PDF/A</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Legal contracts and agreements that may be referenced years later</li>
                <li>Tax documents and financial records requiring long-term retention</li>
                <li>Medical records and patient documentation</li>
                <li>Academic research and publications</li>
                <li>Historical documents and personal archives</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <!-- Content Section 5: Security Features -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Enterprise-Grade PDF Security</h2>
            <p>Protecting sensitive documents is paramount. ScanLens provides multiple layers of security to keep your PDFs safe from unauthorized access.</p>
            <h3>Password Protection</h3>
            <p>Add password protection to any PDF with a single tap. ScanLens uses AES-256 encryption—the same standard used by banks and governments—to ensure your documents remain private. You can set separate passwords for opening the document and for editing or printing.</p>
            <h3>On-Device Processing</h3>
            <p>Unlike some scanner apps that upload your documents to cloud servers for processing, ScanLens performs all scanning, OCR, and PDF creation directly on your iPhone. Your sensitive documents never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to share or backup them.</p>
            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h4>Privacy First</h4>
                <p>ScanLens has no ads, no tracking, and no data collection. Your documents are your business, and we keep it that way.</p>

    <!-- Content Section 6: Export & Sharing -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Export and Share Your PDFs Anywhere</h2>
            <p>Once your PDF is ready, ScanLens makes it easy to get it where it needs to go. Export directly to your favorite cloud storage services, share via email or messaging apps, or save locally to your device.</p>
            <h3>Supported Export Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>iCloud Drive:</strong> Automatic sync across all your Apple devices</li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive:</strong> Access your scans from any device with Google integration</li>
                <li><strong>Dropbox:</strong> Seamless integration with your existing Dropbox workflow</li>
