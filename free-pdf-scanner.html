    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Most Free PDF Scanner Apps Are Not Really Free</h2>
            <p>Search for "free scanner app" and you'll find dozens of options. Download one, scan a document, and hit a paywall. Want to export as PDF? Subscribe. Need OCR? Premium feature. Tired of ads? Pay to remove them. The watermark on your scans? That goes away at $9.99/month.</p>
            <p>This "freemium" model isn't really free—it's a trial with unlimited restrictions. You can technically scan, but the resulting files are barely usable without paying. For students, small businesses, and personal use, these costs add up quickly.</p>

    <!-- How Free Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Can a PDF Scanner App Be Free?</h2>
            <p>Fair question. If other apps charge $10/month for features we include for free, what's the catch?</p>

            <h3>On-Device Processing Eliminates Server Costs</h3>
            <p>Most scanner apps send your documents to cloud servers for OCR processing. That costs money per scan—servers, bandwidth, computing power. They have to charge to cover those costs.</p>
            <p>ScanLens processes everything on your iPhone using the Neural Engine. No cloud servers, no per-scan costs. The processing power is already in your pocket—you paid for it when you bought your phone.</p>

            <h3>Use Your Existing Cloud Storage for PDFs</h3>
            <p>Other apps charge for cloud storage in their proprietary systems. ScanLens uses your existing cloud accounts—iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive. You're already paying for that storage. We don't need to build and maintain expensive cloud infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Sustainable Free PDF Scanner Model</h3>
            <p>We may offer optional premium features in the future for users who want more—advanced editing, additional integrations, team features. But core scanning will remain free. Our goal is to build something useful that people actually want to use, then offer enhancements for those who need them.</p>

            <h2>Free PDF Scanner: No Gotchas, No Surprises</h2>

            <h3>Free PDF Scanner Without Trial Period</h3>
            <p>This isn't a 7-day trial. Features don't expire. You won't get a popup on day 8 asking you to subscribe or lose access. Download today, use it next year—same features, same free.</p>

            <h3>Free PDF Scanner Without Usage Limits</h3>
            <p>Scan 5 documents or 5,000. Create 10 PDFs or 10,000. No monthly quotas, no "you've reached your limit" messages. Use the app as much as you need.</p>

            <h3>Free PDF Scanner Without Feature Teasing</h3>
            <p>We don't show you grayed-out premium features to make you feel like you're missing out. If a feature exists in the app, you can use it. No "upgrade to unlock" buttons on core functionality.</p>

            <h3>Free PDF Scanner Without Ads Ever</h3>
            <p>We don't show ads. We don't sell your data. We don't track your scanning behavior for marketing purposes. Documents are processed on your device, never sent to our servers.</p>

                    <summary>Is ScanLens really completely free?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, core scanning features are genuinely free: document scanning, OCR text recognition, PDF creation, cloud sync, multi-page documents, and e-signatures. No subscriptions required, no ads, no watermarks on exports. We may add optional premium features later, but these core capabilities will remain free.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What do other scanner apps charge for?</summary>
                    <p>Common paywalled features include: OCR text recognition ($5-10/month), removing watermarks from exports, unlimited PDF exports, cloud sync and backup, ad-free experience, and e-signatures. Some apps use aggressive "freemium" models where basic scanning is free but anything useful requires payment.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does a free app make money?</summary>
                    <p>ScanLens uses on-device processing, eliminating expensive cloud server costs that force other apps to charge. We may offer optional premium features in the future for power users, but core scanning functionality will remain free. The goal is sustainable growth, not extracting maximum revenue from every user.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Are there hidden costs or limitations?</summary>
                    <p>No hidden costs. Scan unlimited documents, create unlimited PDFs, use OCR without limits. Cloud sync works with any service you already use (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive) at no additional cost. No usage quotas, no export restrictions, no artificial limitations designed to push you to pay.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why are some scanner apps so expensive?</summary>
                    <p>Cloud-based OCR processing costs money—servers, bandwidth, and computing resources for every scan. Apps that process on remote servers must charge to cover those ongoing costs. ScanLens uses your iPhone's Neural Engine for on-device AI processing, which eliminates per-scan costs and enables truly free OCR.</p>
