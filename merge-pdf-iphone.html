    <!-- Why Merge PDFs -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Merge PDFs on iPhone</h2>
            <p>Documents rarely exist in isolation. A contract has multiple sections. A report includes appendices. An application requires supporting documents. Sending these as separate files creates confusion—recipients don't know which to open first, files get lost in email threads, and version control becomes a nightmare.</p>
            <p>Merging PDFs solves this by combining related documents into a single, organized file. Recipients get one attachment. Page order is controlled. The entire document package travels together, opens together, and prints together.</p>
            <p>Previously, this required desktop software. Now you can merge PDFs directly on iPhone—wherever you are, whenever you need to.</p>

    <!-- How to Merge -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How to Combine PDFs on iPhone Step by Step</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 1: Open PDF Merge Tool</h3>
                <p>In ScanLens, navigate to PDF Tools and select "Merge PDFs." The merge interface opens, showing your document library.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 2: Select PDF Files to Combine</h3>
                <p>Tap to select the PDFs you want to merge. Selected files are highlighted and numbered in selection order. Choose from your ScanLens library, iCloud Drive, or import from Files app.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 3: Arrange Document Order</h3>
                <p>Drag files to reorder them. The merged PDF follows this sequence—first file becomes first pages, second file follows, and so on. Preview thumbnails help you verify the order is correct.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 4: Merge and Name the Result</h3>
                <p>Tap "Merge" to combine all selected files. Enter a name for the merged document. The new PDF is saved to your library, ready to share, export, or further edit.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Best Uses for PDF Merging</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Merge Contract Sections into One PDF</h3>
                <p>Legal contracts often consist of multiple documents: main agreement, schedules, exhibits, and signature pages. Merge them into a single PDF before sending for signature. Recipients see the complete contract in one file, reducing confusion and ensuring nothing is missed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Combine Report Chapters and Appendices</h3>
                <p>Business reports grow across multiple files—executive summary, main findings, data tables, appendices. Merge them in the correct order before distribution. Stakeholders receive one professional document instead of a folder of separate files.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Merge Receipts for Expense Reports</h3>
                <p>Business trips generate multiple receipts: flights, hotels, meals, transportation. Merge all receipts into a single PDF for your expense report. Accounting receives one organized file instead of a dozen attachments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Combine Application Documents</h3>
                <p>Job applications, visa applications, and university admissions require multiple supporting documents. Merge your resume, cover letter, transcripts, and certificates into one PDF. Upload or email a single comprehensive file.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Merge Scanned Pages into One Document</h3>
                <p>Scanning a multi-page document sometimes creates separate files per page. Merge them into a single PDF that represents the complete document. This is especially useful for scanning at different times or from different sources.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Without Desktop -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Merge PDFs Without Desktop Software</h2>
            <p>Traditional PDF merging required Adobe Acrobat or similar desktop software. This meant waiting until you had computer access, transferring files between devices, and paying for expensive software licenses.</p>

            <h3>When Mobile PDF Merging Matters</h3>
            <p>You're at a client site and need to combine documents before a meeting. You're traveling and must submit an application before a deadline. You're in a conference and need to compile notes from multiple sessions. In all these cases, waiting for desktop access isn't an option—merging PDFs on iPhone keeps you productive.</p>

            <h2>PDF Merge Quality and File Size</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Lossless PDF Combination</h3>
                <p>ScanLens merges PDFs without recompressing images or altering content. The merged file contains exact copies of pages from source documents. Text remains searchable, images retain original resolution, and formatting is preserved.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Merged PDF File Size</h3>
                <p>The merged PDF size roughly equals the sum of source file sizes. A 2MB contract plus a 1MB appendix creates approximately a 3MB merged file. There's minimal overhead from the merge process itself.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Compress After Merging</h3>
                <p>If the merged PDF is too large for email, use PDF compression after merging. ScanLens offers multiple compression levels to balance quality and file size. Reduce a 10MB merged document to 3MB while maintaining readability.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is there a limit to how many PDFs I can merge?</summary>
                    <p>There's no artificial limit on the number of PDFs you can merge. Combine as many documents as you need—contracts with dozens of exhibits, reports with multiple chapters, or receipt collections from month-long trips.

                <details class="faq-item">

                    <p>Yes, you can drag files to reorder them before merging. The merged PDF follows the sequence you arrange. This is essential for contracts (main document first, then schedules), reports (summary before details), and applications (resume before supporting documents).</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
