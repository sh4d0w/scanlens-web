    <!-- The Business Case -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Businesses Need a Document Scanner App</h2>
            <p>Modern business happens everywhere—client sites, conferences, home offices, airports. Paper documents don't wait for you to return to the office scanner. A contract needs signing now. An expense receipt will be lost if not captured immediately. A whiteboard diagram needs preserving before the meeting room is cleaned.</p>
            <p>Mobile document scanning puts professional-quality digitization in your pocket. Every employee becomes capable of capturing, processing, and sharing documents instantly. No more delays waiting for scanner access, no more lost documents, no more bottlenecks in paper-dependent workflows.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Business Document Types -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Types of Business Documents to Scan</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Contracts and Agreements</h3>
                <p>Sales contracts, NDAs, vendor agreements, partnership documents. Scan multi-page contracts with batch mode, keeping all pages in a single organized PDF. Add signatures and dates without printing. Share signed documents instantly via email or cloud storage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Invoices and Purchase Orders</h3>
                <p>Capture invoices from vendors and suppliers. OCR extracts key data—amounts, dates, invoice numbers—making documents searchable. Integrate with accounting workflows by exporting to PDF or connecting with cloud-based AP systems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Travel and Expense Receipts</h3>
                <p>Business travel generates paper. Scan receipts for flights, hotels, meals, transportation, and client entertainment. Automatic data extraction captures amounts and vendors. Export for expense reports or integrate with expense management platforms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Cards to Contacts</h3>
                <p>Networking generates stacks of business cards. Scan cards to extract contact information—names, emails, phone numbers, companies. Save directly to Contacts or export for CRM integration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Whiteboards and Meeting Notes</h3>
                <p>Capture whiteboard diagrams, flip charts, and handwritten meeting notes before they're erased. High-contrast processing makes handwriting legible. Share meeting outcomes with attendees immediately.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- Security -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Business Document Scanner Security Features</h2>
            <p>Business documents often contain sensitive information—financial data, legal terms, personal information. ScanLens is designed with security as a priority.</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>On-Device Document Processing</h3>
                <p>Document scanning, OCR, and image processing happen entirely on your iPhone. Documents never leave your device during processing. No cloud servers see your sensitive data unless you explicitly choose to sync or share.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Encrypted Business Document Storage</h3>
                <p>Documents stored locally are protected by iOS's security framework, including hardware encryption and device passcode protection. Cloud sync uses industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Business Document Access Control</h3>
                <p>Require Face ID or Touch ID to access the app. Individual documents can be password-protected for additional security. Control who can access what through your organization's cloud storage permissions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Business Document Compliance Considerations</h3>
            <p>For regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal), ScanLens's on-device processing means sensitive documents aren't transmitted to third-party servers. Your organization's existing compliance frameworks for device management and cloud storage apply. Consult your compliance team for specific requirements.</p>
