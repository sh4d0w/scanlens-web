    <!-- Why Scan IDs -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Scan ID Cards on iPhone</h2>
            <p>Identity documents are required constantly—rental applications, account verifications, employment forms, insurance claims. Each request means digging out your physical ID, finding a scanner or copier, and hoping the result is legible.</p>
            <p>A dedicated ID card scanner app transforms this process. Scan your driver's license once and have a perfect digital copy ready whenever needed. The precision framing ensures nothing is cropped. Both sides are captured and combined into a single image.</p>
            <p>More importantly, keeping ID scans on your device means they're always available. Fill out a rental application at midnight? Your ID scan is ready. Verify your identity for a new account? Share the scan instantly. No physical card handling required.</p>

    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How ID Card Scanner Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Precision ID Frame Guide</h3>
                <p>ID Card mode displays a guide frame matching standard ID dimensions (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1: 85.6 × 53.98 mm). Position your card within the frame for perfect alignment. The guide ensures nothing is cropped and the entire card is captured clearly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Front Side Capture</h3>
                <p>Align your ID card with the guide and capture. The app detects the card edges, corrects any perspective distortion, and enhances contrast for maximum legibility. Photo, name, address, and other details are captured crisply.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Back Side Capture</h3>
                <p>After the front is captured, you're prompted to flip the card. Scan the back side containing barcodes, magnetic stripes, or additional information. The same precision framing ensures both sides match perfectly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Automatic Side Combination</h3>
                <p>Both sides are automatically combined into a single image. Choose vertical stacking (front on top, back below) or horizontal arrangement (side by side). The combined image represents your complete ID in one file.</p>

            <p>Identity documents contain your most sensitive personal information—name, address, date of birth, ID numbers. ScanLens is designed with privacy as the foundation, not an afterthought.</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>All Processing On-Device</h3>
                <p>Every aspect of ID scanning happens locally on your iPhone. Image capture, edge detection, perspective correction, OCR—all processed by your device's hardware. Nothing is sent to external servers.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>No Cloud Upload Required</h3>
                <p>Scanned IDs are stored in your local document library. Cloud backup is optional and under your control. If you enable iCloud sync, Apple's encryption protects your data. Third-party cloud services are never required.</p>

                <h3>Rental Applications</h3>
                <p>Landlords and property managers require ID verification. A clean scan of your driver's license satisfies this requirement. Submit with your application—no need to visit an office to make copies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Employment Onboarding</h3>
                <p>New jobs require identity verification for I-9 forms and background checks. HR departments accept scanned copies. Have your ID scan ready before your first day to streamline paperwork.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Insurance Claims</h3>
                <p>Filing claims often requires proof of identity and insurance cards. Scan both your driver's license and insurance card. Submit with your claim documentation for faster processing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Account Verification</h3>
                <p>Financial services, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online platforms require ID verification. Upload your scanned ID directly to verification portals. The high-quality scan passes automated checks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Travel Documentation</h3>
                <p>Keep scanned copies of IDs when traveling. If your physical wallet is lost or stolen, digital copies help with replacement processes and emergency identification.</p>

        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>ID Scan Quality Requirements</h2>
            <p>Many ID verification systems have specific quality requirements. ScanLens is optimized to meet them:</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Resolution and Clarity</h3>
                <p>Scans are captured at high resolution—all text, photos, and security features are clearly visible. Microprint and fine details that might blur on copiers are preserved in digital scans.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Color Accuracy</h3>
                <p>ID cards use specific colors for security purposes. ScanLens preserves accurate color reproduction. Holograms and color-shifting elements photograph correctly under proper lighting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Edge Detection</h3>
                <p>Automatic edge detection ensures the full card is captured without cutting off corners or edges. The complete card—including rounded corners—appears in the final scan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Glare Reduction</h3>
                <p>Laminated ID cards reflect light, creating glare spots. Scan in diffused lighting or at a slight angle. The app's image enhancement helps reduce minor glare while maintaining readability.</p>

                    <summary>Can I extract text from scanned ID cards?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, OCR text recognition can extract text from scanned ID cards including names, addresses, ID numbers, and dates. All extracted data stays on your device—it's not processed by external servers. Copy extracted text for filling out forms.</p>

                    <summary>How do I avoid glare on laminated IDs?</summary>
                    <p>Scan in diffused natural light rather than direct overhead lighting. If you see glare, tilt the card slightly or change your angle. Avoid using flash. The app's enhancement features can reduce minor glare, but starting with good lighting gives best results.</p>
