    <!-- Why Compress -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Compress PDFs on iPhone</h2>
            <p>Large PDFs create real problems. Email servers reject attachments over 25MB. Cloud storage fills up quickly. Downloads take forever on slow connections. Recipients get frustrated waiting for files to open.</p>
            <p>Scanned documents are especially problematic. A 10-page scan can easily exceed 50MB when captured at high resolution. Multi-page reports with embedded images balloon to hundreds of megabytes.</p>
            <p>PDF compression solves these problems by reducing file size while maintaining readability. A 20MB scan becomes a 5MB email attachment. A 100MB report fits in cloud storage. Documents open instantly instead of grinding for minutes.</p>

    <!-- How Compression Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How PDF Compression Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Image Recompression in PDFs</h3>
                <p>Most PDF file size comes from embedded images. Compression re-encodes these images at lower quality, dramatically reducing size. A 5MB photo becomes a 500KB image—still clear enough to read, but 10x smaller.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Text and Vector Preservation</h3>
                <p>Text and vector graphics (lines, shapes, charts) aren't affected by compression. These elements remain perfectly sharp regardless of compression level. Only raster images (photos, scans) are recompressed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Compression Algorithm Selection</h3>
                <p>ScanLens uses intelligent compression that analyzes each image type. Photos get JPEG compression. Diagrams get optimized PNG treatment. The algorithm chooses the best approach for each embedded element.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>PDF Compression Quality Levels Explained</h2>
            <p>Choose the right balance between file size and visual quality:</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">

                        <td>70%</td>

                        <td>50%</td>

                        <td>Screen viewing, web uploads</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

            </table>

            <h3>Choosing the Right Compression Level</h3>
            <p><strong>Maximum Quality:</strong> Use when image quality matters—photography portfolios, design documents, or files destined for printing. Minimal size reduction but maximum visual fidelity.</p>
            <p><strong>High Quality (Recommended):</strong> The sweet spot for most uses. Noticeable size reduction with minimal visible quality loss. Perfect for email attachments and professional sharing.</p>
            <p><strong>Medium Quality:</strong> Significant compression for screen viewing. Images look fine on displays but may show artifacts if printed large. Good for web uploads and quick shares.</p>
            <p><strong>Low Quality:</strong> Maximum compression for smallest files. Text remains readable but photos look soft. Use for archival storage, text-heavy documents, or when file size is critical.</p>

    <!-- When to Compress -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>When to Compress vs Keep Original PDF</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Compress PDF for Email Attachments</h3>
                <p>Most email services limit attachments to 25MB. Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo all enforce this. If your PDF exceeds the limit, compress it. High Quality usually brings files under the threshold while maintaining readability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Compress PDF for Cloud Storage</h3>
                <p>Free cloud tiers offer limited space—15GB for Google Drive, 5GB for iCloud. Compressing archived documents frees storage for more files. Low Quality works well for documents you rarely access.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Compress PDF for Faster Downloads</h3>
                <p>Sharing documents via link? Recipients download faster when files are smaller. A 50MB PDF takes minutes on slow connections; a 10MB compressed version downloads in seconds.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Keep Original for Print and Archive</h3>
                <p>If the PDF will be printed professionally, keep the original high-resolution version. Compression artifacts become visible in print. For legal archives requiring exact reproductions, also keep originals.</p>

                    <summary>How much can PDF compression reduce file size?</summary>
                    <p>Typical results by compression level: Maximum quality reduces by ~15%, High quality by ~35%, Medium by ~55%, and Low by ~70%. Actual savings depend on content—image-heavy scans compress dramatically, while text-only PDFs see minimal reduction since text is already compact.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does PDF compression reduce quality?</summary>
                    <p>Compression reduces image quality proportionally to the compression level chosen. Text and vector graphics (charts, diagrams, logos) remain perfectly sharp at any level. For documents with important photos, choose Maximum or High quality to maintain visual clarity.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's the best compression level for email?</summary>
                    <p>High Quality (70% image quality) is recommended for most email attachments. It typically reduces file size by ~35% while maintaining good readability. For documents with detailed images, use Maximum Quality. For text-heavy documents, Medium Quality works well.</p>

                    <summary>Can I preview compression before saving?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, ScanLens shows the estimated file size before and after compression. You see exactly how much space you'll save before applying any changes. If the reduction isn't sufficient, adjust the compression level and preview again.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is my PDF uploaded to a server for compression?</summary>
                    <p>No, all compression happens locally on your iPhone. Your documents are never uploaded to external servers. This keeps your files private and means compression works even without internet connection.</p>
