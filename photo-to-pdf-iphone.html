        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Convert Photos to PDF</h2>
            <p>Photos are great for viewing, but they're not ideal for sharing documents. Send someone five JPGs and they arrive as separate files, possibly in wrong order, possibly with confusing filenames. Recipients don't know which to open first.</p>
            <p>PDFs solve this by packaging images into a single, ordered document. Page 1, page 2, page 3—the sequence is clear. The file opens in any PDF reader. Pages can be printed together. The document is self-contained and professional.</p>
            <p>Converting photos to PDF is essential when submitting applications, sharing portfolios, sending records, or creating any multi-image document that needs to stay organized.</p>

        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How to Create PDF from Photos on iPhone</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 1: Import Photos to Convert</h3>
                <p>Open ScanLens and tap Import. Select photos from your Camera Roll—tap each photo you want to include, or use Select All for an entire album. You can also capture new photos directly with the in-app camera.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 2: Arrange Photo Order</h3>
                <p>Drag photos to arrange them in the order you want. The first photo becomes page 1, second becomes page 2, and so on. Preview thumbnails show the sequence before you create the PDF.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 3: Configure PDF Settings</h3>
                <p>Choose page size: A4 for standard documents, Letter for US standard, or Original to preserve photo dimensions. Select quality level based on your needs—Maximum for print, Medium for email, Low for smallest files.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 4: Create and Share PDF</h3>
                <p>Tap Create PDF. The app generates your document in seconds. Share immediately via email, AirDrop, or messaging. Save to Files, iCloud Drive, or other cloud storage. The PDF is ready to use.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Multiple Photos -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Combine Multiple Photos into Single PDF</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Select Multiple Images at Once</h3>
                <p>In the photo picker, tap multiple images to select them. Selected photos show a checkmark and number indicating their order. Select 5, 50, or 500 photos—there's no artificial limit on how many you can combine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>One Photo Per Page</h3>
                <p>Each selected photo becomes one page in the resulting PDF. A 10-photo selection creates a 10-page PDF. Photos are scaled to fit the chosen page size while maintaining aspect ratio.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Reorder Before Creating</h3>
                <p>After selecting photos, drag to reorder them. Put the cover image first, arrange content in logical sequence, end with final pages. The PDF preserves exactly the order you arrange.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>When to Convert Photos to PDF</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Photo Documentation for Insurance</h3>
                <p>Insurance claims require photo evidence—damage photos, receipts, police reports. Convert all documentation photos into a single PDF. Adjusters receive one organized file instead of a dozen scattered images.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Real Estate Listing Photos</h3>
                <p>Agents share property photos with clients. Convert listing photos into a PDF brochure—exterior, kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms in logical order. Clients get a professional presentation they can review and share.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Product Photos for Catalogs</h3>
                <p>Small businesses create product catalogs from smartphone photos. Convert product images to PDF with consistent page sizes. Print or share digitally—a professional catalog without graphic design software.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Photo Portfolios for Artists</h3>
                <p>Artists and photographers share work via PDF portfolios. Convert your best images into a single document. Add to job applications, send to galleries, or share with potential clients—one file showcases your work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>ID and Document Photos</h3>
                <p>Applications often require photos of IDs, passports, or documents. Convert these photos to PDF for submission. Many systems prefer PDF uploads over raw image files.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do I convert a photo to PDF on iPhone?</summary>
                    <p>Open ScanLens and import photos from your Camera Roll. Arrange them in the desired order, choose page size and quality settings, then tap Create PDF. The resulting document can be shared immediately via email, messaging, or saved to cloud storage.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I combine multiple photos into one PDF?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, select as many photos as you need and they'll be combined into a single PDF document. Each photo becomes one page. Drag to reorder pages before creating the PDF. There's no limit to how many photos you can combine into one document.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What page sizes are available?</summary>
                    <p>ScanLens offers A4 (international standard), Letter (US standard), Legal (extended US), and Original (preserves photo dimensions). A4 and Letter are best for standard documents. Original is ideal when you don't want any cropping or borders.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does converting to PDF reduce image quality?</summary>
                    <p>You control the quality level. Maximum quality preserves original resolution—perfect for printing. Lower quality settings compress images to create smaller files suitable for email or screen viewing. You can preview results before saving.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Are my photos uploaded to a server?</summary>
                    <p>No, all conversion happens locally on your iPhone. Your photos never leave your device. This protects your privacy and means the conversion works even without internet connection.</p>
