            <h2>Why Scan Documents with Your iPhone?</h2>
            <p>Gone are the days of bulky flatbed scanners and trips to the copy shop. Your iPhone's camera, combined with intelligent software, can produce professional-quality document scans in seconds. Modern scanner apps use advanced edge detection, perspective correction, and image processing to transform casual photos into clean, readable documents.</p>
            <p>Whether you need to digitize receipts for expense reports, archive important contracts, or quickly share a signed form, iPhone scanning is faster and often produces better results than traditional methods. The key is knowing the right techniques and avoiding common mistakes that lead to poor-quality scans.</p>

                        <h3>Prepare Your Document</h3>
                        <p>Place your document on a flat, stable surface. Choose a background that contrasts with your paper—a dark desk for white paper, or a light surface for colored documents. Smooth out any wrinkles or folds, as these create shadows that reduce scan quality.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="step-item">

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Set Up Proper Lighting</h3>
                        <p>Good lighting is the single most important factor for quality scans. Position yourself near a window for natural light, or use a bright desk lamp. The light should come from the side, not directly above, to minimize shadows and glare. Avoid mixed lighting (natural + artificial) which can cause color casts.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="step-item">

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Position Your iPhone</h3>
                        <p>Hold your iPhone parallel to the document surface, not at an angle. Maintain a distance of 8-12 inches—close enough to capture detail, far enough to include the entire document. Keep your elbows tucked for stability. For best results, position so the document fills about 80% of the screen.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Let the App Work</h3>
                        <p>Open ScanLens and point at your document. The app automatically detects edges—you'll see a blue or yellow overlay highlighting the detected area. Wait for the overlay to stabilize on all four corners, then tap to capture or wait for auto-capture. The app corrects perspective and enhances contrast automatically.</p>

                        <h3>Review and Enhance</h3>
                        <p>After capture, review the scan. Adjust corner positions if edge detection missed slightly. Apply filters: Grayscale for text documents, Color for photos or diagrams, High Contrast for faded documents. Most scanner apps also offer brightness and rotation adjustments.</p>

                        <p>Choose your output format. PDF is best for multi-page documents and professional sharing. JPG or PNG work for single images or social sharing.

            <h2>Pro Tips for Perfect Scans</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Best Distance to Scan Documents on iPhone</h3>
                <p>Your document should fill approximately 80% of the camera frame. Too close and edges get cut off; too far and you lose detail. This sweet spot gives the app enough margin for edge detection while maximizing resolution on the actual content.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>How to Avoid Shadows When Scanning Documents</h3>
                <p>If you're scanning in less-than-ideal lighting, try the "angled light" technique: position your light source at a 45-degree angle to the document, coming from the left or right side. This creates even illumination without the harsh shadows caused by overhead lighting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Multiple Pages into One PDF on iPhone</h3>
                <p>For large documents, use batch mode. Stack your pages in order, then scan from top to bottom. ScanLens maintains page order and lets you rearrange before creating the final PDF. Tip: fan through pages first to prevent sticking, especially with glossy paper.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Best Scan Filters for Different Documents</h3>
                <p>Grayscale (B&W): Legal documents, contracts, printed text. Color: Receipts with logos, diagrams, photos. High Contrast: Old or faded documents, handwritten notes. Auto-enhance: When you're unsure—let the AI decide based on content detection.</p>

    <!-- Troubleshooting Section -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

            <h3>Fix Blurry Document Scans on iPhone</h3>
            <p>The most common cause is camera movement during capture. Brace your elbows against your body or the table edge. Ensure adequate lighting—low light forces longer exposure times, increasing blur risk. Clean your iPhone camera lens with a microfiber cloth. If blur persists, tap the screen to manually focus on the document before capture.</p>

            <h3>iPhone Scanner Edge Detection Not Working</h3>
            <p>This usually happens when there's insufficient contrast between document and background. Try a different surface color. Ensure even lighting across the entire document—shadows can confuse edge detection. If the document has dark borders (like some forms), try placing it on an even darker surface or a white surface depending on which provides more contrast.</p>

            <h3>Fix Skewed Document Scans on iPhone</h3>
            <p>Keep your iPhone parallel to the document surface. If you're scanning at an angle, perspective correction may not fully compensate. Some apps let you manually adjust corners after capture—use this to fine-tune problematic scans. For bound books, gently press the pages flat or use the book scanning mode if available.</p>

            <h3>Improve Scan Text Quality on iPhone</h3>
            <p>If text appears pixelated or hard to read, you may be too far from the document. Move closer while keeping the full page in frame. Increase lighting intensity. Try the High Contrast or Grayscale filter to sharpen text edges. For very small text (like legal fine print), consider scanning in sections at higher resolution.</p>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I scan documents with just my iPhone camera?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, you can use the built-in Notes app or Files app to scan documents. However, dedicated scanner apps like ScanLens offer better edge detection, OCR text recognition, and export options. The native Camera app alone can take photos but won't apply document scanning enhancements like perspective correction or contrast optimization.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why are my scanned documents blurry?</summary>
                    <p>Blurry scans are usually caused by camera movement, poor lighting, or being too close to the document. Hold your iPhone steady (brace your elbows), ensure good lighting (natural light or bright lamps), and maintain 8-12 inches distance for sharp results. Also check that your camera lens is clean.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do I scan multiple pages into one PDF?</summary>
                    <p>In ScanLens, tap the multi-page icon before scanning. Capture each page sequentially, reviewing each as you go. When finished, tap 'Done' to combine them into a single PDF document. You can rearrange pages, delete unwanted ones, or add more pages before finalizing.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's the best lighting for scanning documents?</summary>
                    <p>Natural daylight from a window provides the most even, color-accurate lighting. For artificial light, use bright, even illumination from the side rather than directly overhead. Avoid mixed lighting sources and direct sunlight which can cause harsh shadows and glare.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I scan documents without an internet connection?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, document scanning works completely offline. ScanLens processes everything on-device using your iPhone's Neural Engine. You only need an internet connection to share documents via email, upload to cloud services, or sync across devices.</p>
