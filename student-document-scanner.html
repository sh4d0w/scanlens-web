            <h2>Why Students Need a Document Scanner App</h2>
            <p>Academic life generates paper: handwritten notes, textbook pages, printed handouts, graded assignments, research materials. Traditional organization means binders, folders, and the inevitable "I know I wrote it somewhere" frustration during exam prep.</p>
            <p>A scanner app transforms this chaos into searchable digital files. Every note you've ever taken becomes findable with a quick search. Study materials sync across your devices—laptop, iPad, phone. Collaborate with classmates by sharing scanned notes. Back up everything automatically so a lost notebook doesn't mean lost work.</p>

                <h3>Scan Lecture Notes for Students</h3>
                <p>Handwritten notes during lectures capture your thinking in ways typed notes can't. But paper notes are hard to search and easy to lose. Scan your notes after class—handwriting OCR makes them searchable. Find "mitochondria" or "French Revolution" across all your notes instantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Textbook Pages for Study</h3>
                <p>Need a specific diagram or passage from a textbook? Scan the relevant pages for quick reference. Create a personal library of key pages without carrying heavy books. Add highlights and annotations to scanned pages for active studying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Class Handouts and Syllabi</h3>
                <p>Professors distribute printed handouts, syllabi, and reading lists. Scan and organize by class. Never miss a due date because you lost the syllabus. Search for specific assignments or readings across all your courses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Classroom Whiteboard Photos</h3>
                <p>Complex diagrams, formulas, and explanations written on whiteboards during class are gold. But phone photos are often unreadable. ScanLens enhances whiteboard captures—correcting perspective, boosting contrast, and making diagrams crisp and clear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Research Materials and Library Books</h3>
                <p>Library books, journal articles, archival documents—research generates paper you can't take home. Scan key pages and passages. OCR makes them searchable and quotable. Organize by project or paper.</p>

            <p>Include the class, topic or date, and content type. Consistent naming makes browsing effective even without search.</p>

            <h3>Scan Notes Immediately After Class</h3>
            <p>Build the habit of scanning notes right after class while they're still fresh. Waiting until the end of the semester means a mountain of paper. Daily scanning takes seconds and keeps your digital library current.</p>

    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Is Scanning Textbooks Legal for Students?</h2>
            <p>Students often ask whether scanning textbook pages is legal. The short answer: scanning for personal study is generally permitted under fair use doctrine, but there are important boundaries.</p>

            <h3>Legal Ways to Scan Textbooks for Study</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scanning pages from textbooks you own for personal study</li>
                <li>Scanning limited excerpts from library books for research</li>
                <li>Capturing diagrams or charts for reference</li>
                <li>Creating personal study materials from your own books</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Illegal Ways to Share Scanned Textbooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scanning entire textbooks and sharing them</li>
                <li>Distributing scanned materials to avoid purchasing</li>
                <li>Commercial use of scanned academic content</li>
                <li>Replacing library or course reserve access with scans</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When in doubt, scan only what you need for your own studying, and don't distribute copyrighted materials. Most academic scanning for personal use falls well within fair use protections.</p>

                    <summary>Is ScanLens free for students?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, ScanLens is free to download and use. Core scanning features including OCR, PDF creation, and cloud sync are available without payment. There's no student discount to worry about because the app is already free. This makes it ideal for students on tight budgets.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I scan handwritten notes and make them searchable?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, ScanLens uses AI-powered handwriting recognition (OCR) to convert your handwritten notes to searchable text. Accuracy depends on handwriting clarity—neat notes typically achieve 90-95% accuracy, while rushed or messy handwriting may be 70-85%. Even imperfect OCR still makes notes findable.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is it legal to scan textbook pages?</summary>
                    <p>Scanning textbook pages for personal study purposes generally falls under fair use in the United States and similar doctrines in other countries. You can scan pages from books you own or library books for your own studying. Sharing complete scanned textbooks would violate copyright laws.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How can I organize scanned notes by class?</summary>

ScanLens syncs to your cloud storage, and the search function helps find specific topics across all your scanned materials.</p>
