    <!-- Content Section 1: Built for iPhone -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why a Native iPhone App Matters</h2>
            <p>ScanLens isn't a cross-platform app ported to iOS—it's built from the ground up specifically for iPhone using Swift and Apple's native frameworks. This means faster performance, lower battery usage, and seamless integration with the features you already use on your iPhone.</p>
            <p>Native apps can access iPhone capabilities that web apps and cross-platform tools simply cannot match. From the camera API to system-level integrations like Shortcuts and Siri, ScanLens takes full advantage of what makes iPhone special.</p>
            <p>The result is an app that feels like it belongs on your iPhone. The interface follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, animations are smooth at 120fps on ProMotion displays, and everything just works the way you expect it to.</p>

    <!-- Content Section 2: iCloud Integration -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Seamless iCloud Sync</h2>
            <p>Your scanned documents follow you everywhere thanks to deep iCloud integration. Scan a receipt on your iPhone at a restaurant, and it's already waiting on your Mac when you get home to do expenses. No manual syncing, no third-party cloud accounts required.</p>
            <h3>How iCloud Sync Works</h3>
            <p>ScanLens stores your documents in iCloud Drive, making them accessible from any device signed into your Apple ID. Changes sync automatically in the background—rename a file on your iPad, and the change appears on your iPhone within seconds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic backup:</strong> Your scans are safely stored in iCloud, protected by Apple's encryption</li>
                <li><strong>Offline access:</strong> Downloaded documents remain available even without internet</li>
                <li><strong>Storage management:</strong> Optimize storage by keeping full-resolution files in the cloud</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-device handoff:</strong> Start scanning on iPhone, continue organizing on iPad or Mac</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h4>Works with iCloud Family Sharing</h4>
                <p>Share scanned documents with family members through iCloud shared folders. Perfect for household paperwork, school documents, or family projects.</p>

    <!-- Content Section 3: Shortcuts Automation -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Automate Everything with Shortcuts</h2>
            <p>The iOS Shortcuts app transforms ScanLens into a powerful automation tool. Create custom workflows that scan, process, and file documents exactly the way you want—without touching any buttons.</p>
            <h3>Example Automations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Receipt scanner:</strong> Tap one shortcut to scan a receipt, add today's date to the filename, and save to your Expenses folder</li>
                <li><strong>Contract workflow:</strong> Scan a document, add your signature, convert to PDF/A, and email to your lawyer</li>
                <li><strong>Time-based filing:</strong> Automatically organize scans into folders by month or project</li>
                <li><strong>NFC triggers:</strong> Tap an NFC tag at your desk to instantly open ScanLens in scanning mode</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also trigger ScanLens actions from other apps using Shortcuts. Scan documents directly from your task manager, note-taking app, or any app that supports the Shortcuts framework.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Privacy Built Into the Foundation</h2>
            <p>Apple users care about privacy, and so do we. ScanLens processes all documents locally on your device—your scans never pass through our servers. This isn't just a feature; it's a fundamental design principle.</p>
            <h3>How We Protect Your Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-device OCR:</strong> Text recognition happens entirely on your iPhone using Apple's Vision framework</li>
                <li><strong>No cloud processing:</strong> Unlike competitors, we don't upload your documents for "enhancement"</li>
                <li><strong>No analytics on content:</strong> We never analyze, read, or index your scanned documents</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud encryption:</strong> Documents synced to iCloud are encrypted end-to-end</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Check our App Privacy label on the App Store—ScanLens collects no data linked to your identity. Your documents are yours alone.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>ScanLens vs. iPhone's Built-in Scanner</h2>
            <p>Yes, iPhone has a built-in document scanner in the Notes and Files apps. It's convenient for quick scans, but serious document management requires more. Here's how ScanLens compares:</p>
            <table class="comparison-table">

                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>For occasional scanning, the Notes app works fine. But if you scan documents regularly, need OCR search, or handle sensitive documents requiring signatures and encryption, ScanLens is the clear choice.</p>
