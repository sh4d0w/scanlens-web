    <!-- Why Book Scanner -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Use a Book Scanner App</h2>
            <p>Scanning books one page at a time is tedious. Flip page, scan, flip page, scan—for a 300-page textbook, that's 300 separate captures. The spine gets in the way. Pages curve near the binding. Text distorts at the center.</p>
            <p>A dedicated book scanner app solves these problems. Scan both visible pages in a single capture. The app automatically splits them into separate pages, preserving reading order. What would take hours becomes a matter of minutes.</p>
            <p>For students scanning textbook chapters, researchers digitizing journal articles, or anyone preserving old books, a book scanner app transforms an impossible task into a practical one.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Book Page Splitting Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Landscape Capture Mode for Open Books</h3>
                <p>Book Scanner mode switches your iPhone to landscape orientation, matching the shape of an open book. The wider field of view captures both pages in a single frame with maximum resolution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Spine Alignment Guide</h3>
                <p>An orange center line on screen shows exactly where to position the book's spine. Aligning the spine with this guide ensures the split happens at the right place—no content lost, no overlap between pages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Automatic Page Detection</h3>
                <p>After capture, the app detects the spine position and automatically divides the image into left and right pages. The algorithm handles curved pages near the binding, ensuring text remains readable even close to the spine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Correct Reading Order</h3>
                <p>Pages are saved in reading order: left page first, then right page. When you scan pages 42-43, they're stored as page 1 (42) and page 2 (43) in your document. The entire book maintains proper sequence.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Best Practices for Scanning Books</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Flatten Pages Before Scanning</h3>
                <p>Books naturally curve near the spine. For best results, gently press on the pages to flatten them before scanning. A book weight or your hand at the top and bottom edges works well. Don't press so hard that you damage the binding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Use Good Lighting for Book Scans</h3>
                <p>Even lighting prevents shadows across pages. Natural daylight is ideal. Avoid direct overhead lights that cast shadows from your phone. If scanning at night, use multiple light sources from different angles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Keep Camera Parallel to Book</h3>
                <p>Position your iPhone directly above the book, parallel to the pages. Angled shots create perspective distortion—text appears larger on one side than the other. The app corrects minor angles, but starting parallel gives better results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan in Batches for Long Books</h3>
                <p>For entire textbooks, scan in chapter-sized batches. This keeps documents manageable and lets you pause and resume. A 300-page book becomes 10 documents of 30 pages each, easier to organize and search.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- Use Cases -->

            <h2>Book Scanner for Students and Researchers</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Textbook Chapters for Study</h3>
                <p>Library textbooks can't leave the building. Scan the chapters you need and study anywhere. OCR makes scanned text searchable—find specific terms, create digital highlights, and build searchable study materials.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Digitize Journal Articles</h3>
                <p>Academic journals often exist only in print archives. Scan articles for your research library. With text extraction, you can search across all your scanned papers, finding relevant passages and citations instantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Preserve Old and Rare Books</h3>
                <p>Family histories, old cookbooks, out-of-print references—some books are irreplaceable. Scanning preserves them digitally. Create searchable archives of books that exist nowhere else. Share with family or researchers worldwide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Reference Materials</h3>
                <p>Manuals, catalogs, and reference books contain information you need occasionally but not constantly. Scan the relevant sections. When you need specifications or procedures, search your digital library instead of hunting for the physical book.</p>

                    <summary>How does two-page book scanning work?</summary>
                    <p>Book Scanner mode captures an open book in landscape orientation. Position the book's spine on the orange center line. When you capture, the app automatically splits the image into two separate pages—left page first, then right page—preserving correct reading order throughout your document.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does it work with thick books?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, automatic splitting handles books of any thickness. The spine detection adapts to curved pages near the binding. For best results with very thick books (500+ pages), press gently on the pages to flatten them before scanning. Some users find a book weight helpful.</p>

                    <summary>Can I search text in scanned book pages?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, OCR text recognition extracts searchable text from all scanned pages. Search specific passages, quotes, or terms across your entire scanned book library. Extracted text can be copied for notes, citations, or research papers.</p>

                    <summary>What types of books work best?</summary>
                    <p>Any book that can lie reasonably flat works well: textbooks, paperbacks, hardcovers, journals, magazines, old records, and photo albums. Library books with tight bindings may need gentle pressure to flatten pages. Spiral-bound books lie flat naturally and scan excellently.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How many pages can I scan in one document?</summary>
                    <p>There's no hard limit on pages per document. However, for very long books, scanning in chapter-sized batches (30-50 pages) is recommended. This keeps documents manageable, allows you to pause and resume, and makes searching and organizing easier.</p>
