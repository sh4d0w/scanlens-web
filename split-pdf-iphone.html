    <!-- Why Split -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Split PDF Files</h2>
            <p>Large PDF documents are unwieldy. A 100-page report is difficult to email, slow to load, and overwhelming to navigate. Sometimes you only need specific pages—chapter 3, the appendix, or pages 15-20.</p>
            <p>Splitting PDFs solves these problems by creating smaller, focused documents from larger files. Share just the relevant section instead of the entire document. Create handouts from specific chapters. Separate combined invoices into individual files.</p>
            <p>On iPhone, this previously meant uploading to web services or waiting until you had desktop access. Now you can split PDFs instantly, privately, wherever you are.</p>

            <h2>How to Split PDF on iPhone</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 1: Open PDF to Split</h3>
                <p>Open the PDF document you want to split in ScanLens. Import from your document library, iCloud Drive, email attachments, or the Files app. Browse page thumbnails to understand the document structure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 2: Choose Split Mode</h3>
                <p>Select how you want to split the document: "Each Page" creates a separate PDF for every page, "Into Parts" divides into equal sections (2, 3, 4, or more parts), or select specific pages to extract.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 3: Configure Output</h3>
                <p>Set a naming prefix for the output files. If you choose "Report," files are named Report-1.pdf, Report-2.pdf, etc. This makes organizing split files straightforward.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Step 4: Split and Save</h3>
                <p>Tap Split to process. The app creates your separate PDF files instantly. All files appear in your document library, ready to share, rename, or organize into folders.</p>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>When to Split PDF Documents</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Extract Chapters from Reports</h3>
                <p>Annual reports, research documents, and manuals have multiple chapters. Split to extract just the section you need. Share the relevant chapter without forcing recipients to navigate a 200-page document.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Separate Combined Invoices</h3>
                <p>Accounting systems often output multiple invoices in a single PDF. Split to create individual invoice files—one per customer, one per transaction. Easier to forward, file, and track.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Create Classroom Handouts</h3>
                <p>Teachers splitting textbook chapters or presentation slides into handouts. Split a 50-page document into 10 sections, each becoming a separate downloadable file for students.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Reduce File Size for Email</h3>
                <p>Large PDFs exceed email attachment limits. Split into smaller parts that fit within size restrictions. Recipients receive multiple emails with manageable attachments instead of a failed send.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Separate Scanned Batches</h3>
                <p>Batch scanning creates one PDF with multiple unrelated documents. Split to separate them—each receipt, each letter, each form becomes its own file for proper organization.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Quality -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Split PDF Quality and File Size</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Lossless Page Extraction</h3>
                <p>Splitting doesn't recompress or alter page content. Each split file contains an exact copy of the original pages—same resolution, same text, same formatting. No quality loss whatsoever.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Proportional File Sizes</h3>
                <p>Split file sizes are roughly proportional to page count. A 10MB, 20-page PDF split into individual pages creates twenty ~500KB files. Splitting in half creates two ~5MB files.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Preserved PDF Features</h3>
                <p>Bookmarks, links, and annotations within the extracted pages are preserved. If page 5 has a hyperlink, it still works in the split file containing page 5.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- vs Merge -->

            <h2>Split PDF vs Merge PDF</h2>
            <p>Split and merge are complementary operations:</p>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Split PDF</td>
                        <td>One PDF → Multiple PDFs</td>
                        <td>Extract sections, separate pages</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Merge PDF</td>
                        <td>Multiple PDFs → One PDF</td>
                        <td>Combine documents, create packages</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Often you'll use both: split a large document to extract chapters, then merge those chapters with other materials into a new compilation. ScanLens supports both operations with the same ease.</p>

                    <summary>Does splitting reduce PDF quality?</summary>
                    <p>No, splitting preserves full quality. Pages are extracted without recompression—the split files contain exact copies of the original pages with identical resolution, text, formatting, and any embedded elements.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is my PDF uploaded to a server for splitting?</summary>
                    <p>No, all splitting happens locally on your iPhone. Your documents are never uploaded to external servers. The operation works offline and keeps your documents completely private.</p>
