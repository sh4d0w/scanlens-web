        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why You Need a Receipt Scanner App</h2>
            <p>Paper receipts are a productivity nightmare. They fade, crumple, get lost in pockets, and pile up in shoeboxes. When tax season arrives or you need to file an expense report, you're left sorting through months of faded thermal paper, trying to decipher amounts and dates.</p>
            <p>The solution isn't just taking photos—it's intelligent scanning that extracts data, organizes receipts automatically, and makes everything searchable. With AI-powered receipt scanning, you snap a picture and the work is done. Amount, date, vendor—all captured instantly and organized for when you need it.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Receipt Scanner App Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Smart Receipt Capture on iPhone</h3>
                <p>Point your camera at a receipt and ScanLens automatically detects the edges, corrects perspective, and enhances contrast. Works on crumpled receipts, poor lighting, and faded thermal prints. The AI is trained on millions of receipt formats worldwide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Extract Data from Scanned Receipts</h3>
                <p>OCR plus specialized receipt parsing identifies key fields: total amount, subtotal, tax, tip (for restaurant receipts), date, time, merchant name, and address. The AI understands receipt layouts from major retailers, restaurants, gas stations, and more.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Automatic Receipt Categorization</h3>
                <p>Based on merchant recognition and extracted items, receipts are automatically tagged with categories: groceries, dining, transportation, office supplies, medical, and more. Override or add custom categories anytime.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Sync and Backup Scanned Receipts</h3>
                <p>Receipts sync across your devices via iCloud. Search and access from iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Everything is backed up automatically—if you lose your phone, your receipt archive is safe in the cloud.</p>

        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Who Needs a Receipt Scanner App?</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Receipts for Business Expense Reports</h3>
                <p>Traveling employees, freelancers, and consultants need organized expense documentation. Scan receipts as you go—at the restaurant, in the taxi, at the office supply store. When it's time to file expenses, everything is already organized with extracted totals ready to export.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Receipts for Tax Preparation</h3>
                <p>Business deductions require documentation. Whether it's home office supplies, vehicle expenses, or business meals, scanned receipts provide the proof you need. Organize by tax category throughout the year, and export for your accountant at tax time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Receipts for Warranty Claims</h3>
                <p>Electronics, appliances, and furniture often have multi-year warranties. When something breaks, you need the original receipt. Scan receipts for major purchases immediately and tag with "warranty"—you'll find them instantly when needed, even years later.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Receipts for Personal Budgeting</h3>
                <p>Understanding spending requires data. Scan receipts to track where money goes. Category totals reveal spending patterns: too much on dining out? More grocery spending than expected? Receipt data makes budgeting concrete.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Receipts for Returns and Exchanges</h3>
                <p>Return policies typically require original receipts. Scan every receipt the moment you make a purchase. If you need to return something, pull up the digital receipt—many stores accept scanned copies, and if not, you have the exact date and amount to locate the transaction.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- Tax Documentation -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Scan Receipts for Taxes: IRS Requirements</h2>
            <p>The IRS accepts digital copies of receipts as valid documentation for deductions. Here's how to use receipt scanning for tax purposes:</p>

            <h3>IRS Requirements for Scanned Receipts</h3>
            <p>For deductions, you need records showing the amount, date, place, and business purpose of expenses. Scanned receipts satisfy the "records" requirement. The digital image must be legible and accurately represent the original.</p>

            <h3>Organize Scanned Receipts by Tax Category</h3>
            <table class="comparison-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Tax Category</th>
                        <th>Example Expenses</th>
                        <th>Retention</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Business Travel</td>
                        <td>Flights, hotels, meals, car rentals</td>
                        <td>7 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Home Office</td>
                        <td>Furniture, equipment, supplies</td>
                        <td>7 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Vehicle Expenses</td>
                        <td>Gas, maintenance, parking</td>
                        <td>7 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Medical Expenses</td>
                        <td>Prescriptions, equipment, visits</td>
                        <td>7 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Charitable Donations</td>
                        <td>Cash, goods (with valuation)</td>
                        <td>7 years</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Export Scanned Receipts for Accountants</h3>
            <p>When tax season arrives, export your categorized receipts. ScanLens generates CSV files that open directly in Excel or Google Sheets. Share the spreadsheet and linked images with your accountant, or use the data for self-filing.</p>

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Best Practices for Scanning Receipts</h2>

            <h3>Scan Receipts Immediately After Purchase</h3>
            <p>The best time to scan a receipt is right after the transaction. Receipts are cleanest and most legible immediately. Thermal paper fades over time—some receipts become unreadable within months. Scan now, not later.</p>

            <h3>Add Notes to Scanned Receipts</h3>
            <p>AI extracts data, but you know the purpose. Add a quick note: "Client lunch with John" or "Supplies for project X." This context is invaluable for expense reports and tax documentation, especially when reviewing transactions months later.</p>

            <h3>Tag Scanned Receipts Consistently</h3>
            <p>Create a tagging system that matches your needs. For business expenses, use categories that align with your expense report system. For taxes, use IRS categories. Consistency makes retrieval and export seamless.</p>

            <h3>Monthly Review of Scanned Receipts</h3>
            <p>Once a month, spend 10 minutes reviewing scanned receipts. Verify extraction accuracy, add missing notes, and ensure categories are correct. This small investment prevents a major time sink at year-end.</p>
