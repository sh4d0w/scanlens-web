    <!-- Why Batch Scan -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Batch Scanning Matters</h2>
            <p>Scanning pages one at a time is tedious. Open app, scan, save, open app, scan, save—repeated for every single page of a 20-page report. Then you have 20 separate files to combine. It's a workflow designed for frustration.</p>
            <p>Batch scanning changes everything. Start one session, scan all pages continuously, get one multi-page document at the end. A 20-page report takes the same effort as a 2-page letter—just keep scanning until done.</p>
            <p>For professionals handling contracts, students digitizing textbooks, or anyone dealing with multi-page documents, batch scanning isn't a nice-to-have. It's essential for practical document digitization.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Batch Scanning Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Continuous Capture Mode</h3>
                <p>After capturing one page, the camera immediately readies for the next. No "save" dialogs, no app navigation—just flip to the next page and scan. The workflow stays uninterrupted until you're done.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Auto-Capture Technology</h3>
                <p>AI-powered edge detection identifies document boundaries in real-time. When a page is properly positioned and stable, capture happens automatically. No need to tap—just hold steady for a moment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Page Counter Display</h3>
                <p>Live counter shows how many pages you've scanned: "Page 1", "Page 2", up to "Page 100". You always know where you are in long documents. No losing track mid-scan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Memory-Efficient Processing</h3>
                <p>Large documents don't crash the app. ScanLens processes images efficiently, freeing memory as you go. Scan 50, 80, 100 pages without slowdown—even on older iPhones with limited RAM.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- Page Management -->

        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Page Management After Scanning</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Thumbnail Review</h3>
                <p>After scanning, view all pages as thumbnails in a scrollable grid. Quick visual overview of the entire document. Spot blank pages, upside-down scans, or missed pages at a glance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Drag to Rearrange</h3>
                <p>Pages out of order? Long-press and drag any thumbnail to its correct position. Scanned the appendix before the introduction? Just drag to rearrange. No need to rescan in correct order.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Delete Unwanted Pages</h3>
                <p>Swipe to delete bad scans, blank pages, or duplicates. Remove page 7 without affecting pages 1-6 and 8-20. Keep the good scans, discard the rest.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Rescan Individual Pages</h3>
                <p>Page 12 came out blurry? Tap to rescan just that page. The new scan replaces the old one in the same position. Fix problems without starting over.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Insert Pages Anywhere</h3>
                <p>Missed a page? Insert new scans at any position in the document. Add page 5a between pages 5 and 6. Complete control over document structure.</p>

    <!-- Use Cases -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Batch Scanning Use Cases</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Multi-Page Contracts and Agreements</h3>
                <p>Legal documents often span 10-50 pages. Batch scan the entire contract in one session. Page numbers ensure correct order. One PDF for the complete agreement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Textbook Chapters</h3>
                <p>Students digitizing study materials can scan entire chapters quickly. Use Book Mode for two pages per capture, doubling speed. A 30-page chapter takes minutes, not an hour.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Receipt Collections</h3>
                <p>Monthly expense reports with dozens of receipts? Scan all receipts in one batch. Each receipt becomes a page in a single expense PDF. Accounting simplified.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Medical Records</h3>
                <p>Patient files often include multiple forms, test results, and notes. Batch scan the complete file. Organized, searchable digital records for each patient.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Archive Digitization</h3>
                <p>Converting paper archives to digital? Batch scanning makes mass digitization practical. Folder by folder, box by box—systematic conversion of years of documents.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Meeting Notes and Whiteboards</h3>
                <p>Capture all whiteboard photos and handwritten notes from a meeting. One document per meeting with all visuals in sequence. Reference materials preserved together.</p>

    <!-- Tips -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Batch Scanning Tips for Best Results</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Prepare Your Stack</h3>
                <p>Before scanning, organize pages in correct order. Remove staples and paper clips. Flatten folded documents. A prepared stack scans faster than sorting during capture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Consistent Lighting</h3>
                <p>Set up in a well-lit area with even lighting. Shadows and glare slow down auto-capture as the system waits for optimal conditions. Good lighting means faster scanning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Flat Surface</h3>
                <p>Use a dark, non-reflective background. A dark desk or black paper helps edge detection. The camera distinguishes document edges more clearly against contrasting background.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Steady Positioning</h3>
                <p>Auto-capture triggers when the image stabilizes. Hold the phone steady for a moment after positioning each page. Stability equals faster capture.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I rearrange pages after scanning?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, after scanning all pages, view thumbnails in a grid. Long-press and drag any thumbnail to rearrange order. You can also delete unwanted pages or rescan individual pages without losing other scans.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does auto-capture work for batch scanning?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, auto-capture uses AI edge detection to identify document boundaries and captures automatically when the page is properly positioned and stable. You can also tap manually to capture if you prefer more control.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I add more pages to an existing document?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, open any saved document and tap 'Add Pages' to scan additional pages. New pages can be inserted at any position—beginning, end, or between existing pages. Documents grow as needed.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What if I scan a page badly?</summary>
                    <p>Tap the bad page in thumbnail view and choose 'Rescan'. The camera opens for that specific page. Your new scan replaces the old one in the same position. No need to delete and reorder.</p>
