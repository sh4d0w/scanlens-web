    <!-- The Problem -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Why Scan Business Cards to Contacts</h2>
            <p>You meet someone at a conference, exchange business cards, and promise to connect. The card goes in your pocket. A week later, you find it crumpled at the bottom of your bag—if you find it at all. By then, the connection is cold.</p>
            <p>Manual data entry is worse. Typing names, emails, and phone numbers takes time and introduces errors. A mistyped email means your follow-up bounces. A wrong digit in a phone number means you can't call.</p>
            <p>A business card scanner app solves both problems. Scan the card the moment you receive it. AI extracts all contact information accurately. One tap saves to your iPhone Contacts. The card's job is done—the relationship begins.</p>
        </div>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>How Business Card Scanner Works</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Point and Scan Business Card</h3>
                <p>Open the business card scanner mode and point your iPhone camera at the card. The app detects card edges automatically, captures when aligned, and enhances the image for optimal text recognition. Works in any lighting condition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>AI Extracts Contact Information</h3>
                <p>Advanced OCR reads all text on the card. But reading isn't enough—the AI understands context. It knows that "john@company.com" is an email, "+1 555-123-4567" is a phone number, and "VP of Sales" is a job title. Each piece of information is categorized correctly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Review Extracted Contact Details</h3>
                <p>Before saving, review extracted information. All fields are editable—fix any OCR errors, add notes about where you met, or remove information you don't need. The card image is saved alongside the contact data for reference.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Save to iPhone Contacts</h3>
                <p>One tap creates a new contact in your iPhone address book. Name, company, title, phone numbers, emails, websites, and social profiles—all saved instantly. The contact syncs across your devices via iCloud.</p>

            <h2>Business Card Scanner for Networking Events</h2>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Cards at Conferences</h3>
                <p>Conferences mean dozens of new connections in a single day. Scan each card immediately after receiving it. Add a quick note about the conversation while it's fresh: "Interested in partnership" or "Follow up about Q2 project." When you're back at the office, all contacts are organized and annotated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Cards at Trade Shows</h3>
                <p>Trade shows are lead generation goldmines. Sales teams collect hundreds of cards per event. Scanning eliminates the post-show data entry marathon. Every lead is in your CRM-ready format within seconds of the handshake.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Cards at Client Meetings</h3>
                <p>Meeting a new client team? Scan cards during introductions. You'll have everyone's contact information before the meeting ends—no awkward requests for email spellings or phone numbers later.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Scan Business Cards for Job Searching</h3>
                <p>Job seekers meet recruiters, hiring managers, and potential colleagues at career fairs and informational interviews. Scanning their cards ensures you can follow up promptly with a thank-you note and your resume.</p>

    <!-- Both Sides -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Scan Both Sides of Business Cards</h2>
            <p>Many business cards have information on both sides—contact details on front, company description on back, or different languages on each side. ScanLens handles this intelligently:</p>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Front and Back Card Capture</h3>
                <p>After scanning the front, the app prompts for the back side. Flip the card and scan again. Both images are captured and processed together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Smart Contact Merging</h3>
                <p>Information from both sides is merged into a single contact. The AI avoids duplicates—if the same email appears on both sides, it's saved once. Complementary information is combined: name from front, social profiles from back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-highlight">
                <h3>Multi-Language Business Cards</h3>
                <p>International business cards often have English on one side and another language on the other. ScanLens recognizes text in 14 languages and extracts contact information regardless of which language it's in.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <!-- Social Media Detection -->
    <section class="content-section content-section-alt">
        <div class="container container-narrow">
            <h2>Social Media Profile Detection</h2>
            <p>Modern networking happens online as much as in person. Business cards increasingly include social media handles alongside traditional contact information.</p>

            <h3>Supported Social Platforms</h3>
            <p>ScanLens detects and extracts profiles from major platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> — Professional profiles (linkedin.com/in/username)</li>
                <li><strong>Twitter/X</strong> — Handles (@username format)</li>
                <li><strong>Instagram</strong> — Personal and business accounts</li>
                <li><strong>Facebook</strong> — Personal profiles and business pages</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Social Profiles Matter</h3>
            <p>A LinkedIn connection request immediately after meeting reinforces the contact. You can learn more about someone's background, see mutual connections, and engage with their content. Social profiles saved to contacts make this follow-up seamless.</p>
